## About the Project
Welcome to **Rainy Days**.
<br><br>
 This project evolved through two distinct course assignments: HTML & CSS and JavaScript 1. Initially, I created a fully responsive and accessible website for the HTML & CSS course. In the JavaScript 1 course, I expanded the project by integrating live product data from the Rainy Days API, transforming it into an interactive online store.

### User Stories  
* As a user, I want to view a list of products on the homepage.  
* As a user, I want to filter products by category, gender, or genre.  
* As a user, I want to view a single product page with more detail.  
* As a user, I want to add a product to my basket.  
* As a user, I want to remove a product from my basket.  
* As a user, I want to view a summary of my cart on the checkout page.  
* As a user, I want to view an order-confirmation screen after checking out.
